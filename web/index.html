<p>A computer is an electronic device that takes input such as number, text,sound,image, animations video,etc, processes it, and convert it into meaninful informationn that could be understood, presenting the changed input (processes input ) as output. All numbers, text, sound, images, animations,and video used as input are called information. Input is the raw data entered into the computer by using input devices.The data consist of numbers,text, sound, images, animations, and The process coverts numbers, text, sound, images, animations, and video (data) into usable data which is called information.The process converts of n number, text, sound, images, animations, and video that has been coverted by the process.The data is inserted using an input device.The central processing unit (CPU) convert data to information.the information is put on an output device.A storage device is an apparatus for storing data and information. A basic computer consist of four components: an input device, a CPU, output device, and memory.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The term "Hardware" refers to the physical elements of a computer; the machinery or the electronics in a computer.A basic computer consist of four majour components:</p>
<li>1. input device (or input unit)</li>
<li>2. CPU (central processing unit)</li>
<li>3. memory (or memory unit)</li>
<li>4. output device (output unit)</li>

<h2>Input unit and Output unit (i/O)</h2>
<p>Input unit sends things (data) to the computer and output unit presents things (information). Input unit: keybord, mouse, flash drive,etc. Output unit: monitor, printer, speaker,etc. </p>
<img src="WEB3.jpg" alt="WEB3">
<p>Input and output unit or input and output device (I/O) provide a way to interact with a computer. Some examples of  I/O devices are: keyboard used to input text, mouse, touch pad, camera, monitor,Speaker, touchscreen for simultaneous input and output.</p>
<h2>Examples of hardware (I/O) in a computer are:</h2>
<div>

<li><b>keyboard</b></li> 
<div>
<p>A computer will process data differently based on the kind of data being handled, using a set of instruction called a program or routing.</p>

<li><b>Computer case</b></li>
<div>
<img src="case.jpg" alt="case">
<p>The CPU, motherboard, memory and any internal components are typically put Into a computer case/housing.</p>

<li><b></b>Monitor</li>
<div>
    <img src="monitor.jpg" alt="monitor" width="1200" length="1200">
<p>A computer monitor is the most commonly used graphical output device, for the information processed by the CPU.</p>
<li><b></b>Mouse</li>

<li><b></b>Printer</li>

     <li><b></b>Speaker</li>
     <img src="speaker.jpg" alt="speaker" width="1000" lenght="1000">


<p><b></b>Most of the computer’s hardware cannot be seen as it is inside the computer case. Example: memory,
CPU, etc.</p>
<li><b></b>memory unit</li>
<p>The memory unit is what allows a computer to remember data and information. Similar to human
Memory, there is short term memory (RAM) and long term memory (HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD), solid-state 
Drive (SDD) or computer Disk Drive (CDD)).</p>

<h1><b>Example of hardware (Memory) in a computer are:</h1>
<li><b>RAM (Random Access memory)</li>
    <img src="ram.webp" alt="ram">



<li><b>Hard disk drive</li>
    <img src="hard.webp" alt="hard disk drive" width="900" length="900">
<li><b>Compact disk drive</li>
    <img src="compact.jpg" alt="compact disk drive">



<h3><b></b>Solid-state drive</h3>
<p>When a computer is turned off, it forgets everything in the RAM (short term memory), while it saves everything it will need later into a disk drive (long term memory). When data is needed by the CPU, it’s sent from the hard disk (HDD) or compact disk drive (CDD) to the RAM tends to be faster to process, whereas HDD/CDD have more data and require longer to process. CDDs let you change certain parts of the memory, essentially like a book or notebook that you might read and get information from. A storage medium gives your computer a place to store data and information that it might need in order to operate. Some things that could be stored in memory might be: text documents, photo, programs, and the operating system (OS).</p>
<h3><b></b>CPU</h3>
<img src="CPU.jpg" alt="cpu">
<p>The CPU (or central processing unit) performs arithmetical and logical operations of the computer system.</p> 
<h3><b></b>Examples of hardware (CPU) in a computer are:</h3>
<p>CPU, top view and CPU, bottom view</p>

<p>The central processing unit, or processing, is the component of a computer that performs processes.</p>
<h3><b></b>Example of the other tasks performed by the CPU include:</h3>
<p>Input/output directions (reading data from an input device/writing information to an output device) storing data in memory.</p>
<h3><b></b>Motherboard</h3>
<img src="" alt="motherboard">
<p>The motherboard is hardware that makes connections between all of the other components in a computer, effectively telling data where it should go.</p> 
<h3><b></b>Example of hardware (Motherboard) in computer is:</h3>
